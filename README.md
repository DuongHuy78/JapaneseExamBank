# Japanese Exam Bank

## Project Goals

The main goal of this project is to use AI to automatically generate Japanese language questions and answers, helping users practice and learn Japanese efficiently. In addition, the project aims to apply and consolidate knowledge of Java, Java Swing, and MySQL in a practical context.

## Project Description

Japanese Exam Bank is an open-source platform designed to collect, generate, and organize exam questions for different levels of Japanese language proficiency. The system utilizes AI via API to extract questions and search for answers from images of exam questions provided by users. This enables rapid digitization and enrichment of the question bank.

The application allows users to:
- Upload images of exam questions, then use AI to process and extract both the questions and possible answers.
- Create, add, and edit questions directly in the system.
- Generate practice tests by selecting questions from the existing question bank.

The project is implemented using Java for core logic, Java Swing for the graphical user interface, and MySQL for data storage. It is structured for ease of use, scalability, and ongoing improvement through community contributions.
